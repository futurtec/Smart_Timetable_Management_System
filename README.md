## Project Overview

[cite_start]This project, **"Smart Timetable Management System,"** aims to provide a centralized and intelligent platform to help students manage their academic schedules effectively[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Developed as part of the **CPM 22503: PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS** course at the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka, this system will integrate personal profiles with automated timetable generation, notifications, and other essential university announcements[cite: 1, 2, 9].

## Key Features (Scope)

The system is designed with several core modules to enhance the student experience:

### 1. User Authentication & Profile Management
* [cite_start]Secure student registration using the university registration number[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]Features for secure login, password recovery, and profile updates (department, academic year, enrolled courses)[cite: 14, 15].

### 2. Personalized Timetable
* [cite_start]**Automatic Timetable Generation** based on the student's enrolled courses[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]Detailed class information, including course name, time, day, lecturer, and classroom[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]Multiple viewing modes: **daily, weekly, and monthly**[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]In-app personal note-taking feature for class entries[cite: 20].

### 3. Notifications & Reminders
